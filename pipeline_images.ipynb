    "A chessboard is used for camera calibration since its regular patterns of high contrast make it easy to detect automatically. So, if we use our camera to take multiple pictures of chessboard agaisnt a flat surface, then we will be able to detect any distortion by looking at the difference between the appartent size and shape of the squares of the chessboard pattern.\n",

    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",

    "\n",
    "After applying calibration, thresholding, and a perspective transform to a road image, we have a binary image where the lane lines stand out clearly. However, we still need to decide explicitly which pixels are part of the lines and which belong to the left line and which belong to the right line.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define this using the hist function from NumPy. With this histogram we are adding up the pixel values along each column in the image. In our thresholded binary image, pixels are either 0 or 1, so the two most prominent peaks in this histogram will be good indicators of the x-position of the base of the lane lines. We should get a output that looks as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can use a sliding window, placed around the line centers, to find and follow the lines up to the top of the frame. We use the two highest peaks from our histogram as a starting point for determining where the lane lines are, and then use sliding windows moving upward in the image (further along the road) to determine where the lane lines go. Here is how it is done -\n"

    "2. Once we have found all our pixels belonging to each line through the sliding window method, it's time to fit a polynomial to the line. We store the x and y co-ordinates of these pixels in lists leftx, lefty, rightx and righty.\n",
    "3. After fitting a 2nd order polynomial using the NumPy function [np.polyfit()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html), we plot the lines using a linspace model on our image.\n",
